                BRAIN CHIP <br>
                In a semiconductor memory chip, each bit of binary data is stored in a tiny circuit called a memory cell consisting of one to several transistors. The memory cells are laid out in rectangular arrays on the surface of the chip.
            </div>
            <div class="box bglightblue textblue"> EYE CAM<br>

                A webcam consists of an image sensor, a lens, and a processor. The image sensor captures video footage, while the lens focuses the light onto the sensor. The processor then converts the captured information into a digital format that can be transmitted over the internet.
            </div>
            <div class="box bgcoral textblue"> EAR AUDIO <br>
                The function of a microphone in a computer is to pick up sound, just like a microphone used by a singer on stage, and convert the audio sound waves into electrical signals. From there, these electrical signals travel to the sound card, where they are converted into digital signals, able to be processed by the computer.            </div>
            <div class="box bgorange textblue">SPEAK BOX <br>
                Speakers are the electromagnetic wave that converts electromagnetic waves into sound waves. The computer provides audio input to the speakers. This input might be analogue or digital in form. Analogue speakers simply amplify analogue electromagnetic signals to produce sound waves.            </div>
            <div class="box bgyellow textblue"> MOUSE PAD <br>
                A mouse typically controls the motion of a pointer in two dimensions in a graphical user interface (GUI). The mouse turns movements of the hand backward and forward, left and right into equivalent electronic signals that in turn are used to move the pointer.            </div>
            <div class="box bgpurple textblue"> FAN <br>
                The computer fan works by spinning its blades, which creates airflow inside the computer case. The fan draws in cool air from the surroundings and pushes it over the heat-generating components like the central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU).            </div>
            <div class="box bgcream textblack">KEYBOARD <BR>
                As the key is pressed, a switch closes and current flows into a small chip in the keyboard. Each key on the keyboard has an associated number, called a scan code. The number is based on where the key is on the keyboard. This is useful when it comes to keyboards that have different layouts and/or symbols.            </div>
            <div class="box bgdgreen textblue"> CPU <br>
                The CPU interprets, processes and executes instructions, most often from the hardware and software programs running on the device. The CPU performs arithmetic, logic, and other operations to transform data input into more usable information output.            </div>
            <div class="box bgred textblue"> POWER SUPPLY <BR>
                A power supply takes the AC from the wall outlet, converts it to unregulated DC, and reduces the voltage using an input power transformer, typically stepping it down to the voltage required by the load. For safety reasons, the transformer also separates the output power supply from the mains input.            </div>
